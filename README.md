# [GDLearn #2] Breakout Clone

This is the second entry on my personal challenge, the **GDLearn**. My goal is to upload at least one game to itch.io every month, on an attempt to learn about video game development using the Godot Engine.

Breakout Clone is a simplified version of Atari's classic game of the same name.

Be aware this is a prototype made for learning purposes only.

## Controls

- Use "SpaceBar" to shoot the ball on a random direction

- Use "A" and "D" or "Left Arrow" and "Right Arrow" to control the paddle;

- Use "R" to reset the game;

Enjoy!
